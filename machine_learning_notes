tensor flow

do the gpu part later. Gotta check if I have it on linux or windows

https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#InstallingAnaconda
do all the stuff. used python 3.6.1

aww no it didn't run probably should check the nvidia stuff since I installed the gpu one.
yay run this program to test:
# Python
import tensorflow as tf
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(hello))

From chapter 2, ESL

KNN
find k observations with xi closest to x
how to choose k?
    increasing k means less variance, more bias
distance can be measured in euclidean, manhattan, hamming graph theory or other math stuff

It then estimates the conditional probability for each class, that is, the fraction of points in A with that given class label. 

then input x gets assigned to the class with the largest probability.


that's a good description without the maths
except how does it estimate prob? Something to do with an indicator function indicating if in set X subset A in X is all 1, anything not A in X is 0...

Least Squares:
assumes that linear fit is good
    low variance, high bias

loss functons L(Y, f(X)) penalize errors in predictions

common to use Y - f(X)^2

beautiful soup is used to read html for data scraping
Mechanize also useful
